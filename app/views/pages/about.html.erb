<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I currently work remotely as a full-stack developer for a company in Columbus, Ohio, where I've worked for the last 12 years developing desktop and web applications for Ohio's DD community. I am an active learner of all things development-related and I love to spend time learning and growing in new technologies and skills through personal projects and freelance work.</p>
